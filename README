We wanted to give a bit of information about the Web version of our project...

NOTE: make make sure you have passed valid arguments to FlightGear.

enter this line in the Settings->Additional Settings box:
--generic=socket,out,10,nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn,5400,tcp,generic_small

the Web part of out project uses ASP.NET MVC by Microsoft to achieve a web MVC structure, which allows us to serve 4 RestFul API URLs:

/display/ip/port - connects to FlightGear on the given ip and port and displays the planes current position on a map.

/display/ip/port/sec - connects to FlightGear on the given ip and port and displays the planes position on the map every 'sec' seconds.

/save/ip/port/perSec/sec/filename - saves to a file named 'filename' the locations of the plane during the next 'sec' seconds, taking the
planes position from FlightGear 'perSec' times per each second.

/display/filename/perSec - loads an animation showing the route saved using the above URL 'perSec' times per each second.

Enjoy FlightInterp_Web!
